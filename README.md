# Loan Amortization Calculator

## Overview

The Loan Amortization Calculator is an Angular application designed to assist users in estimating their monthly payments, total interest paid, and visualizing their loan repayment schedule over time. This tool provides a comprehensive form for entering loan details, performs amortization calculations, and displays the results in both tabular and graphical formats.

## Objective

Develop an Angular application that:
1. Allows users to input loan details.
2. Calculates the monthly payments and generates an amortization schedule.
3. Visualizes the repayment schedule using interactive charts.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Loan Input Form**
   - **Loan Amount**: Amount of the loan.
   - **Interest Rate**: Annual Percentage Rate (APR).
   - **Loan Term**: Duration of the loan in years.
   - **Start Date** (Optional): The date when the loan starts.

2. **Amortization Calculation**
   - Compute the monthly payment using the standard amortization formula.
   - Generate an amortization schedule with a breakdown of each monthly payment, including principal, interest, and remaining balance.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Display the amortization schedule in a table format.
   - Provide an interactive chart (e.g., line or bar chart) showing the decreasing principal balance and interest portion over time.

4. **Additional Features (Optional)**
   - Option for users to make extra payments and view their impact on the payoff timeline and total interest paid.
   - Ability to adjust payment frequency (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly).
   - User authentication and data persistence for saving and retrieving loan calculations.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Core framework for building the application.
- **Angular Material**: For UI components and styling.
- **Chart.js**: For interactive chart visualizations.
- **NgRx** (optional): For state management, if needed for future enhancements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:4200`.

2. **Input Loan Details**

   - Enter the loan amount, annual interest rate, loan term, and optional start date into the form.
   - Click the "Calculate" button to generate the amortization schedule.

3. **View Results**

   - The application will redirect you to a page displaying the amortization schedule in a table.
   - An interactive chart will be shown, visualizing the repayment breakdown over time.

## Components

- **LoanInputComponent**: Manages the loan input form and triggers the calculation.
- **AmortizationTableComponent**: Displays the amortization schedule in a table format.
- **AmortizationChartComponent**: Renders interactive charts for data visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user authentication and data persistence.
- Allow users to make extra payments and see their impact on the loan schedule.
- Provide additional options for payment frequency (e.g., bi-weekly payments).
